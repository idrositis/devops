# DevOps - Scripts &amp; Notes

I have been working on the SysAdmin &amp; DevOps universe for quite some time now. Keeping some notes here and there, while developing couple of scripts to make my life easier, more automated and less boring.

I decided to move all scripts and notes here, to possibly save some time and pain from your life. Comments and improvements more that welcomed!-)

  - [`init.d`](init.d) scripts for applications that don't provide one by default
  - [Notes](notes) that might help you solve (common) problems quicker

_-Pain shared is pain (and time) divided; code shared is joy multiplied._
